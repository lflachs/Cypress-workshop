## You're onboard

Super ! Now you've done a tour of the application! The boss start to ask you to implement a new feature. You're super excited!

You start asking your boss what is the company testing strategy. Bad news, the boss looked at you like he never heard about testing before...

Since you're a good developper and you don't want to loose your new job because you broke the whole application, you start explaining the idea of testing to your boss.

He think that this is a wonderfull idea! And asks you to create the tests.

But you don't know yet how to proceed...

## Your task

Whenever you have to implement tests in an existing project, it's important to start by writing tests that will ensure that the application is fully working.

Also, it's important to prioritize. That's why you should start by testing the most critical feature of the application first.

Of course ideally you want to test every features and make sure everything work. But when working on an existing project, you will sometimes need to prioritise to increase step by step the test coverage of a project.

We are going to discover how to write E2E tests with Cypress, your mission after we wrote the first test will be to create another test for a feature of your choice.
